 It's weird being old at a punk show. Being old and still the youngest is even weirder.

My friends and I are old. All well over fifty. We still like to get together, have drinks, reminisce about the old days and get nostalgic  with our old music. 
We have jobs, some of us have kids, houses, responsibilities. When The John Doe Trio came back to our area, my group of old old-friends made telephone calls with and planned to make a weekend out of it. That means, choosing a house to host and a central place for an Uber ride to depart from. The show was the next town south of mine, about 15 miles away. We called an uber and were dispatched to show on time and primed to party. And party we did! 

"Hell, I'm not driving! Make it a double" I am pretty sure I said about eleven times that night.
